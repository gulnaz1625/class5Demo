Practice making Line comments and Block Comments

## Why Use Java Comments?
It's good practice to get into the habit of putting Java comments into your source code to enhance its readability and clarity for yourself and other programmers. It isn't always instantly clear what a section of Java code is performing. A few explanatory lines can drastically reduce the amount of time it takes to understand the code.

## Do They Affect How the Program Runs?
Implementation comments in Java code are only there for humans to read. Java compilers don't care about them and when compiling the program, they just skip over them. The size and efficiency of your compiled program will not be affected by the number of comments in your source code.

## Implementation Comments
Implementation comments come in two different formats:

## Line Comments
For a one line comment, type "//" and follow the two forward slashes with your comment. For example:
   single line comment : we use double slash to create single comment
    //examples :
    //hello
    //asdas
    //dasd

## Block Comments

To start a block comment, type "/*". Everything between the forward slash and asterisk, even if it's on a different line, is treated as a comment until the characters "*/" end the comment. For example:

/* this 
 is 
 a
 block
 comment
 */
 
 /* so is this */
